# hello-world
my first repository on Github, everything from undergraduate-Biomedical Engineering at University of Miami. and so on in the future...

Updated: BBOP(Baby Brain Optimization Project) lab work for analyzing Brainwaves Electro Encephalogram, or EEG. Only has the ones that are non proprietary

I added all the codes from MIT Applied Data Science program, there are 3 big projects for 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Marketting Analysis 
2. Streeview House number recognition using Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
3. Malaria Detection using Convolutional Neural Network for Cell Image Classification

I also added programming assignments for Linear Algebra for Machine Learning Course by 
Imperial College London.

Updated 6/3: Added all the codes from Master's in Data Analytics (Machine Learning, Neural Network, Protein Folding Capstone project, Quantum Computing/Quantum Chemistry, Natural Language Processing)
