# hello-world
my first repository on Github, everything from undergraduate-Biomedical Engineering, and BBOP(Baby Brain Optimization Project) lab work for analyzing Brainwaves 
Electro Encephalogram, or EEG.

I added all the codes from MIT Applied Data Science program, there are 3 big projects for 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Marketting Analysis 
2. Streeview House number recognition using Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
3. Malaria Detection using Convolutional Neural Network for Cell Image Classification

I also added programming assignments for Linear Algebra for Machine Learning Course by 
Imperial College London.
